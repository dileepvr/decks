Project has reached a stage where it can be put in haitus. It has served its purpose for us. View git commit logs for more info.
The file param.template should be self-explanatory. 
MIT public license has now been added.
The only thing left to do is to simulate other players at a table, specify their positions and strategies, etc.

Okay. So far, it works in CPU.
Tested by running a single trial with one bet and printing entire table to stdout. Type 'make check' to execute.
Cards are numbered 1 through 13. 1 is ace.

All parameters are supplied through a param file.
Refer to param.template for sample values.

Add new strategy rules to function pdecision().

shoe[52*8] array contains cards in shoe.
dealer[21] array contains cards drawn by dealer.
player[8][21] contains cards drawn by player.
Its a 2D array to account for split hands.
bets[8] contains bets on each hand (accounting for splits).
bank contains total bank.

Quite a few global variables like handno, cardno, nhands, etc. are important and shouldn't be used unless you know what you are doing.

Time to make a scheme where bank after N trials are stored in a text
file, which can be plotted later. (bank resets at start of each trial,
see param.template)
